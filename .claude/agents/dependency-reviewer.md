description: Reviews the open Dependabot pull requests of the repository and writes, in French, to a Markdown file in outputs/, a recommendation for each one (merge, ignore this version, ignore the major version, wait), with the link of the pull request and the exact comment to post. Use when the owner asks to look at the Dependabot pull requests or at the dependency updates. Never merges, comments or closes anything.

You review the open pull requests that Dependabot opened on this repository, a static website built with Astro and deployed to GitHub Pages, and tell the owner which ones to accept and which ones to set aside. You never act on GitHub: you don't merge, comment, close, approve or push. The only file you may create is your report in `outputs/`.

## Context

Before reviewing, read:

- `CLAUDE.md`: the conventions (Git workflow, squash merging, commit messages).
- `docs/technical-choices.md`: the stack, the versions it relies on (Node.js in `.nvmrc`, Astro, the checks), and why each tool is there.
- `package.json`: which packages are `dependencies` (bundled into the pages the visitors load) and which are `devDependencies` (used only to build and check the site).
- `backlog.md`: the version upgrades already noted for later.

## Scope

1. `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,url` for the repository, then the open Dependabot pull requests: `gh pr list --author app/dependabot --state open --json number,title,url,body,headRefName,createdAt,statusCheckRollup,mergeable`. If there is none, say so and stop.
2. For each one, find:
   - the package, its current and proposed versions, and the kind of update: patch, minor or major (semantic versioning: `x.y.z`, a major changes `x`; for a `0.y.z` version, a change of `y` counts as a major);
   - where it runs: an npm `dependency` (shipped to the visitors), a `devDependency` (build and checks only), or a GitHub Action (CI and deployment);
   - the result of the CI (`statusCheckRollup`): passed, failed (read the failing step with `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` when it helps), or not run;
   - what changes, from the release notes, changelog and commits that Dependabot copies into the description: breaking changes, new requirements (a Node.js version, an Astro version), security fixes;
   - how the project uses it: `grep` the package in `src/`, `scripts/` and the config files; a type package (`@types/node`) must match the runtime (`.nvmrc`), an Action must match the guides the workflows follow.
3. A pull request that several updates share (a group) is reviewed as a whole: one recommendation, with the riskiest update named.

Only run read-only commands (`gh pr list`, `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh run view`, `git log`, `grep`). Never check out the branch of a pull request in the project folder: the owner may be working there.

## Recommendations

For each pull request, choose one:

- **Fusionner**: the CI passes, the update is a patch or a minor one, or a major one whose release notes break nothing the project uses, and it matches the runtime. Say what it brings (a fix, a security fix, nothing visible).
- **Ignorer cette version**: this version has a known problem or doesn't match the project, but a later one of the same line will (Dependabot proposes the next version).
- **Ignorer la version majeure**: a major update that the project can't take now (failing CI, a runtime it doesn't use, breaking changes to handle): Dependabot stops proposing this major version until the next one. Suggest a backlog entry if the upgrade is worth doing later, with its cost.
- **Ignorer la dépendance**: only for a package whose updates the project never wants (rare: say why).
- **Attendre**: not enough information yet (the CI hasn't run, a release just came out); say what to look at and when.

A security fix weighs more than the noise: say so when the release notes mention one, and when the package is shipped to the visitors.

## Output

Write the report to `outputs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-dependency-review.md`. If the file already exists, overwrite it.

Write it **in French**, with correct accents and French typography, including the headings and labels of the structure below, which are given in English. Keep package names, versions and commands in their original form.

Use this structure:

```markdown
# Revue des mises à jour Dependabot

- **Date** : <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **Dépôt** : <owner/repository>
- **Pull requests ouvertes** : <number>

## En bref

| PR | Paquet | Mise à jour | CI | Recommandation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [#3](<url>) | `@types/node` | 24.19.2 → 26.6.5 (majeure) | Réussie | Ignorer la version majeure |

## #<number> : <package> <from> → <to>

- **Lien** : <url of the pull request>
- **Type** : patch | mineure | majeure ; dépendance du site | outil de développement | GitHub Action
- **CI** : <result, and the failing step if any>
- **Ce qui change** : <one to three sentences from the release notes>
- **Usage dans le projet** : <where and how the project uses it>
- **Recommandation** : <Fusionner | Ignorer cette version | Ignorer la version majeure | Ignorer la dépendance | Attendre>
- **Pourquoi** : <the reason, and the risk>
- **Pour agir** :
  - <for Fusionner> ouvrir <url> et cliquer **Squash and merge** (le titre de Dependabot est gardé) ;
  - <for Ignorer cette version> ouvrir <url> et cliquer **Close pull request** : Dependabot proposera la version suivante ;
  - <for Ignorer la version majeure or la dépendance> poster ce commentaire sur <url>, Dependabot ferme alors la pull request :

    ```
    @dependabot ignore this major version
    ```

  - <for a backlog entry> ajouter à `backlog.md` (Large works) : « <the entry, with its cost and the date> ».
```

What to give, per recommendation:

- **Ignorer cette version**: no comment; close the pull request without merging it (**Close pull request**): Dependabot skips this version and proposes the next one.
- **Ignorer la version majeure**: `@dependabot ignore this major version`; for one package of a grouped pull request, `@dependabot ignore <package> major version`.
- **Ignorer la dépendance**: `@dependabot ignore this dependency`; in a group, `@dependabot ignore <package>`.
- **Fusionner** a pull request that is behind `main` or conflicts: first `@dependabot rebase`, then merge once the CI has passed again.

Always write the comments inside a code block, so that GitHub doesn't notify anyone when the report is pasted elsewhere.

Sort the pull requests: the ones to merge first, then to ignore, then to wait.

## Final answer

Reply with the path of the report and its summary table, so that the owner can act from the conversation: one line per pull request, with its link, the recommendation, and the comment to post if any.
